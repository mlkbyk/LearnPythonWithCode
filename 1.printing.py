#HOW TO PRÄ°NT IN THE PYTHON.

#If you add hashtag '#' this line of code does no work.
#When you want to print something you should use 'print' function with double quoete.
print("Hello World!")

#Printing the cake ingredients.
#When you add to new line you do not need to more tahn once print .You can use '\n'
print("1 cup of sugar.\n1 tablespoon of vanilla.\n3.5 cup of flour.\n1 packet cocoa.\n150 grams of coconut oil.")

#When you combine to different code use the plus '+' sign.
print("I love "+"Maria")

#IMPORTANT!!!!!!!
#If we make a space before print 'indention error 'happens.
#When I add unnecesarry open paranthesis codes does not work right.
