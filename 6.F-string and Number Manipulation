# How to round numbers and what is an f-string and its purpose?
# Using an abridgment.

# Rounding up numbers by default.
print(round(8/3))
print(type(round(8/3)))  # The result is a float.

# It rounds up to numbers, but you can adjust sensitivity in two ways.
print(round(8/3, 2))  # You can specify how many digits you want after the decimal point.
print(type(round(8/3, 2)))  # The result is a float.

# Another way is to use the // operator.
print(8//3)

# The result in this case is not the same as the result of the round function because
# while the round function rounds the number up, the // operator gives the integer part of the division result.
print(type(8//3))  # The result is an integer.

# Some abridgments exist. They are very useful because you do not need a new variable and operation sign.
# These are:  /=  *=  -=  +=
result = 4/2
result /= 2
print(result)

# Using f-string to insert variables into the string. So you can use different data types in just one sentence.
# Firstly, you should use 'f' before the text.
# Secondly, you should use curly braces {}
student_name = "Hermione Granger"  # type=str
potion_grade = 95.6  # type float
dark_magic_grade = 98  # type=int
print(f"Miss or Mister {student_name}\nyour Potion grade is= {potion_grade},\nDark Magic grade is= {dark_magic_grade}")
