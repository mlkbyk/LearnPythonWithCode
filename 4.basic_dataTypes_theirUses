# Basic data types and their uses
# String: A data type that represents text data and is enclosed in single ('), double ("), or triple (''' or """) quotation marks.
example_of_string1 = "Happy"
example_of_string2 = "Sad"
print(example_of_string1 + " " + example_of_string2)

# In Python, there is no need to add quotation marks when printing variables,
# because Python recognizes the variable's data type and processes the variable appropriately when needed.
print("David[0]")  # Also you can reach the letters in a string using 0,1,2... 0=first letter 1=second letter and so on.
# If you add double quotes between numbers, they are treated like text.
print("123" + "456")
# This treats them as part of text, so the output will be '123456' not 579.

# Integer: A data type that represents integers, which are whole numbers without a decimal point.
# In order to create an integer or declare an integer data type, just write a number without anything else.
mom_age = 45
dad_age = 41
print("My parents' age difference is: ")
print(mom_age - dad_age)
# Why we did not write print("My parents' age difference is: " + mom_age - dad_age) because they are different types.
# If you want to solve this, we have some ways, but we will learn later in Type-conversion.
# If you work with long numbers, you can separate them with comma (,) or underscore (_).
print(123, 767, 868)
print(187_855_898_894_878)
# They increase readability and do not appear in the real code.

# Float: A data type that represents floating-point numbers, which are numbers with a decimal point.
score = 13.1

# Boolean: A data type that represents logical values, which can be either True or False.
