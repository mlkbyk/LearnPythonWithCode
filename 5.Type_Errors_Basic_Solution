# What are type errors, in what situations can they occur, and how to solve them?
# TypeError: An error that occurs when an operation is performed on a data type that is not supported
# or compatible with the operation being executed.
letter_of_name = len(input("What is your name? "))
# print("Your name has" + letter_of_name + "letters in it.") If you write this line directly you get a type error.
# Because the len function returns an integer data type. If you want to add with the + sign, you should convert it to int->str.
# Firstly, you can learn data's type with the type function.
print(type(letter_of_name))
# The letter_of_name type is an integer.
string_version_of_num = str(letter_of_name)  # You can convert it like this.
print("Your name has " + string_version_of_num + " letters in it.")

# The input function returns a string, so if you work with numbers you should convert it to int or float.
num1 = input("Enter a number: ")
num2 = input("Enter a number: ")
sum = int(num1) + int(num2)
# Do not forget to convert str again.
print("The sum is " + str(sum))

# But a better way exists when printing different types of data. You can see what it is in the other code. (F strings and rounding)
