#How to use input and len function and their purpose.
#If we want to interactive code we use input function.
#------------>>>>>>>>input("prompt")<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<----------------
#prompt = you will write which do you want.
#You can combine with print statement,such that.
print("Hello "+input("What is your name ?"))
#When you enetered your name output seems like this 'Hello Mimi.'

#We use the'len' function to find out how many letters are in a way.
len("Harry")
#But if you want to see the result you should add 'print' function.
print(len("Harry"))
